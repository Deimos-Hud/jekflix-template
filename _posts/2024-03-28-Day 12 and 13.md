# Day 12:

Easy day today. Starting out at Wesser Bald Shelter, there's a 5.7 mile downhill to the Natahala Outdoor Center (NOC). I got a hostel for the night and my parents will be meeting me there.

On the way down, I turn on the starship IFT-3 stream and listen to it. Today's test continues to test starship capabilities. The launch goes well, making it to orbital velocities this time, with modifications needed to make both sections of the rocket recoverable.

I see some great sites looking into the gap on they way down, until eventually arriving at the NOC. I chill for a few minutes while waiting on my parents to arrive. I've been to the NOC in the summer before and it has different vibes in late winter. Not nearly as busy as I've seen it and with a lot more hikers to tourist ratio then usual.

Eventually my parents arrive with cookies from my sister! I get plenty to eat and hand out goodies to the people trickling into town.

We eventually grab a bite to eat at the rivers end, do some laundry check into my room and more. I'm glad to have the support of my parents throughout this trek. 

We check out the local Bryson City Heritage Museum. Neat little museum with the history of they area. Neat location and a good break from hiking. Eventually we get dinner together at the Rice Wagon, selling Hawaiian food. Had some garlic chicken and it tasted scrumptious. 

After dinner said goodbye to my parents, got cleaned up and headed to bed.





# Day 13


Started at basecamp at NOC. Thunder woke me up around 6 AM, so I went back to sleep. I didn't wake up again until 9 AM, at which point it was still raining hard.

I packed up my stuff and cleaned up and was out of the hostel by 10 AM. From there I got a couple snacks and my permit for the Smokies. The smokies require reservations, either based on shelter by shelter you are visiting or doing an AT Throughhiker permit.

I left NOC around 10:50 AM and started my way out. The first 6 miles out of there has an elevation gain of 2500 feet, very gruesome. It took hours to climb it. I passed by Mossey and his section hiker friends on the way up.

Eventually I make it, and stop by Sassafras gap for a quick break. I keep going to Locust Cove Camp, where despite the early hour I decide to stay. I was exhausted after the hill and did not want to go further. 

Eventually Auggie and Lobster pass by. I had thought they were way ahead of me, but it turned out they had waited out the storm longer than I had. They keep going to the next road, and eventually Mossey and his friends arrive and camp near me as well.

Overall slow day but I did 11 miles so not a complete NERO.
