# Day 12:

Easy day today. Starting out at Wesser Bald Shelter, there's a 5.7 mile downhill to the Natahala Outdoor Center (NOC). I got a hostel for the night and my parents will be meeting me there.

On the way down, I turn on the starship IFT-3 stream and listen to it. Today's test continues to test starship capabilities. The launch goes well, making it to orbital velocities this time, with modifications needed to make both sections of the rocket recoverable.

I see some great sites looking into the gap on they way down, until eventually arriving at the NOC. I chill for a few minutes while waiting on my parents to arrive. I've been to the NOC in the summer before and it has different vibes in late winter. Not nearly as busy as I've seen it and with a lot more hikers to tourist ratio then usual.

Eventually my parents arrive with cookies from my sister! I get plenty to eat and hand out goodies to the people trickling into town.

We eventually grab a bite to eat at the rivers end, do some laundry check into my room and more. I'm glad to have the support of my parents throughout this trek. 

We check out the local Bryson City Heritage Museum. Neat little museum with the history of they area. Neat location and a good break from hiking. Eventually we get dinner together at the Rice Wagon, selling Hawaiian food. Had some garlic chicken and it tasted scrumptious. 

After dinner said goodbye to my parents, got cleaned up and headed to bed.





# Day 13

Big day today. Yesterday Tigger, Waywalker and I decided our best option was to hike 18 miles to allow ourselves plenty of time in Natahala the next day. That puts us at Wesser Bald shelter, near the top of the mountain overlooking the NOC facility we would be staying at.

Tigger and Waywalker leave 20 and 10 minutes earlier than I do. Leaving the shelter was confusing as it was poorly marked and the multiple old logging roads made it difficult to tell where the trail was. Eventually I make it back and hike 6 miles to Wayah bald observation tower. A beautiful old stone tower meant to look for fires, renovated for public use. It was a good spot to see the Natahala forest and barely see the mountains of Georgia still. I dump my trash at a trash can there and keep moving.

Like most of North Carolina so far the trail is poorly marked, with a sign not even mentioning the AT trail, just the local small ones, eventually I set off and hike another few hours past Licklog gap and run into Tigger and Waywalker again. I took a quick lunch with them met a few new people h8king in called Quince and Chef. Tigger MD wants to call me Buzzkill cause i mentioned how he will always remember his bad day by looking at his mismatched shoes. 

We soon push off again, and I start to pull away going foward. Some good views and up and down hills for most of the day. The last gap before the climb to the shelter, Jessica Gap had trail magic! Buncha folks from the area were giving cold drinks and good snacks. I grabbed myself a dr pepper and crackers and chowed down. They had all worked with NOC in the past and started doing this for weary hikers. Buncha other hikers eventually catch up with me and we all relax before our last 2 miles.

The last 2 miles were pretty much all uphill, but it ended with the Wesser Bald firetower, which had a view of the smokies, the next big hurdle. Tigger MD and I met some very loud day hikers there, then moved on.

There was a small downhill section before the shelter and we finally made it. 18 miles was exhausting, but worth it. Also for the first time in NC, the shelter had functional bear cables, so no bear hang tonight! 

We had some great conversations while eating dinner at camp, learned about Maine from a couple from there. We chatted about culture shock, coca cola vs Pepsi, trail names and more.
