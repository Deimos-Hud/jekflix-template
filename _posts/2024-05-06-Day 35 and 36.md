# Day 35 and 36

Today we get into Damascus! I have 10 miles to hike to get there and in those 10 miles, the AT crosses the Tennessee/Virginia state line. That means today is my last day in Tennessee for a long time. There is a special signpost marking the occasion.

>*Just a little more to Damascus!*

Damascus is famous for its Trail Days event that happens in May. We are there a month before the event so the town isn't too busy. In town I am sharing an apartment with Taxi, Tigger and Lobster. Once I set my stuff down, we get some food at the local diner.

After lunch, I head to the local library to work on the blog. The library is a recent addition, in the towns pursuit of expanding and allowing through hikers like myself to have computer access, a rarity on trail. I work there for a bit before meeting up with the gang again to do some grocery shopping.

The rest of the day we rest. The next day we relax. While we pack our bags and fix our food, Tigger makes a breakfast omelet and we watch the Parisâ€“Roubaix, a one day biking race. 

Later I go ahead and get new shoes. my Lone Peaks served me well, but they have gone over 500 miles and need a change. I decided to give the Olympus shoes a try.

I had so many meals throughout the day. Having a proper breakfast, lunch and dinner was amazing and there are ice cream shops too so I had a hearty peach milkshake.

Overall it was a very enjoyable zero day in Damascus, but tomorrow we check out and get back on trail!
