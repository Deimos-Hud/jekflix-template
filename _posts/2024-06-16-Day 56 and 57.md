# Day 56:

Today I leave Stanimals for good. I already ressuplied so the only thing left is to eat blueberry pancakes and head out. Photos and I head to US 60, and whole he slackpacks towards the hostel I'm heading north.

Fortunately yesterday I completed some of the climb to Bald Knob, only making it about 2000 feet of climbing. I see a lot of day hikers out and about, I also help a few of them find their way back to their car.

Towards the end of the day I encounter Spy Rock, a stone topped hill, with nearly 360 degree views of the surrounding area. Some through hikers decided not to come up, which I felt was kinda silly, as it was on a side trail of 130 yards or so.

I make it to the Priest Shelter where I meet up with Huge and Tigger again, along with a dozen or so section hikers. Close to dark Waywalker and Lobster come rolling in. I end the day doing 20 miles and ending at mile 830.


# Day 57:

Wake up and head out of the Priest Shelter by 7:30. I have a short climb up then a 3000 foot decent into the Tyre River Valley. 

It's tiresome hiking so far down constantly, hours of it. I regret not pushing a little further yesterday like Fireman and Yardsale did, as they saved some of the descent.

And once all the way down, it's straight back up. I meet Wildgame at the bottom, before going up. A 3500 foot climb back up the Three Ridges. 

It's a very rough day, but I make the climb after a few breaks. But I feel tired take a long break. Fortunately some day hikers gave me a cold coke when I was going down the other side of the mountain. 

The last few miles are miserable, with the trail not quite following the Blue Ridge Parkway, it instead is below the road out of sight of it, clamoring over rocks without views. Not a difficult hike, but certainly not ideal.

I stop a bit shorter than original plan but I camp around 851, a 21 mile day.
