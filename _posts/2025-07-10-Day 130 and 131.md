# Day 130:

Start at the stealth site. The first few miles are a somewhat gentle downhill to the road. I filled up the water again at the little puddle and moved on.

There's a brief flat section near the road till a campsite, I use the privy and see Harmonica again after he stopped in town yesterday. I then proceed to climb up towards the horns, two peaks. I take a brief lunch break at horn pond lean-to, where there's an old day use shelter built in the 30s. It's an odd design more like a rim of benches with a cover and jagged rocks in the middle.

I proceed to start hiking up the south horn, and it starts to sprinkle a little. It's a tough hike and I was feeling pretty low this morning. Just the tough climbs and the more than 4000 foot climbs in a day get annoying. But getting the first mountain done felt great. Next are the Bigelows. They have great views at the top, with pretty much 360 degree views, and a few section hikers. The rain has stopped for now but will come on heavier later.

I proceed to the little Bigelow and do them, and head to Little Bigelow lean-to where there's several southbounders already there for the night.

# Day 131:

When I wake up at Little Bigelow, the rain is still going. Last night it rained over 2 inches, the tranquil tubs have turned to river rapids here.

When I get going the easy stream to cross into camp turns into a challenge to stay dry, there's a fallen tree a little up river that I use.

Uh note I learned later, saw a group of 3 southbounders and a lady had a duffel bag with her. Turns out it's her pet one winged pigeon she is through hiking with, neat.

The rest of the day is side stepping across muddy trail and bogs. The trail is no longer climbing any significant mountains (the closest thing to a mountain is the 2100 roundtop). There's not much to note mostly just fir, pine and birch trees. I take a break at West Carry Lean-to, but no one visits during that time. 

From there is the Arnold Trail, and much like its namesake Benedict Arnold, it's ugly and annoying as I fail to keep my shoes dry for more than a minute. But hey at least the trail didn't betray America.

Around 3:30 PM the rain starts pouring anew making the last 3.5 miles wet and miserable. Also there's some especially nasty ford crossings I stay wary of. The whole trail is pretty much a stream and despite the efforts of stone diversions, there's no place for all the water to go but the trail. Stepping stones and bridges are flooded.

I make it to Pierces Pond Shelter where several other hikers have set up shop. I meet Joker, a section hiker whose done lots of the trail before and we chat for a bit. Harmonica also shows up later. I actually initially was going to stay there, but using my sat phone I txt my dad and we figure out that the Harrison Camp nearby has spots for 40 bucks. It has hot showers and dry beds so I give it a shot.

(A note from later, one reason I left was that their were a couple there who mistaked my bag for theirs and had even taken out my wallet from my bag. I called them out on it, and they said it was an honest mistake, but I still didn't trust them)

It's about half a mile down the trail, but there's a blue blaze short cut that makes it 0.3 instead, plus it avoids a fording of the river to a proper wooden bridge so it's an obvious choice. Once there I meet Tim and his little dog named Charlie, he's a great dude who gives me the run down and chats about what all he's seen and the flooding of last year. The bridge is his, and it's brand new as the old one was destroyed last year.

I get a nice hot shower and some vegetable leftovers they had and hit the hay.
