# Day 64:

I wake up feeling strong again. I get a bite to eat with the continental breakfast and relax for a bit while I finish packing. I arranged a shuttle to pick me up at 10:30, since I didn't want to have a long first day back.

I also work on the blog some for the first time in a while, I haven't felt like updating it while I was sick. 

Soon enough I get my ride. It's about 50 minutes back to where I was on trail. Today is a shortish day, doing 14 miles to Hightop Shelter. The hike isn't too bad, my body just isn't used to it anymore. My feet and shoulders are more prone to pain and soreness and I'm not as adapted to my trekking poles.

I did stop by the Loft Wayside after hiking a mile or so, and my first wayside is to less fanfare than I thought. Despite me taking time off they are still having power issues at the park. I get a burger and some fries but my appetite is not yet what it used to be, it's a good meal though.


Eventually I make it to Hightop shelter, after a drizzly day and tent for the night, mostly cause the shelter is fairly full and I didn't want to spread whatever remaining germs I had.

# Day 65:

Start out at hightop shelter today, rain is fairly likely after 5pm today so
I'm trying to make it as far until that happens.

After a few miles is a road crossing with working bathrooms, so I stop by and use them.

In all honesty today's hike was a blur, trying to do the same miles I was able to before and not going too fast. Plus the climbs feel brutal but they aren't really. 

I make it to Bearfence mountain Hut, but do decide to hike further to beyond Hazeltop mountain. I did about 16 miles today so I am getting better.

# Day 66:

Wake up to a wet tent, but a mostly dry me. The rain and clouds make it hard to stay completely dry but I managed it minus a couple pieces of equipment.
 
I quickly pack up and head out of Hazeltop mountain to get to the Big Meadows Wayside. It's a 4 mile hike there, and I get a breakfast bowl and a breakfast burrito with eggs sausage, bell peppers and cheese.

Loaded up I keep going. The hike is mostly uneventful, but I realize that the nearby Skyland resort also has a restaurant attached! I go in and order some wings and blackberry cobbler, which was delicious.

I finish the day by hiking up the Pinnicle with great views and stop by Byrds Nest Hut #3, which used to be a picnic shelter. Annoyingly the water source is 0.3 down a hill, but hey it's necessary. I meet Lone Star and his dad, who I had been seeing in the log books. I also ran into Karaoke again, she was at the same shelter I was at a few weeks ago.
