# Day 58:

I wake up early today and pack up. My goal is to get to Waynesboro today and resupply. I quickly go through the miles, as it's mostly downhill, with a slight hill to get to Rockfish Gap, where Waynesboro is.

Once there, there is a long sheet of shuttle drivers who can give rides. I start calling folks and I quickly get a ride after waiting 15 minutes or so. I get dropped off near the Walmart and get shopping. 

So my pants had started to rip so I needed a new pair. Unfortunately the Walmart I was at is just a supermarket, no clothes. So after getting my groceries I ended up stopping at a Family Dollar to get new clothes to wear. Finally I get some cook out to eat and head on my way out.

I end up hiking another couple of miles to the outskirts of Shanendoah National Park and camping off the side of the trail. 


# Day 59:

Start the day, happy and healthy. Because I was stealth camping last night and had town food I had to use the restroom. Conveniently as I entered into Shanendoah there are Porta Potties I can use (this will be on the quiz so remember this).

Shanendoah is beautiful and amazing and an easy low grade hike (meaning the elevation gain is low) the park is known for its waysides (pretty much restaurants) and campstores for supplies. Unfortunately they suffered lots of wind damage in the winter and their power lines are shot. So half of the locations are closed due to no power. 

I also had to buy my hiker permit to camp in the park, fortunately you can just do it online and save it on your phone.

The hike today isn't amazing in terms of views, the trail intersects with the main road several times and there are a few overlooks, but eventually I climb black rock mountain (covered with you guessed it black rocks) and that's pretty. I end up stopping at Dundo Group Campground which is technically closed, but no one minds if I camp there and use the couple of facilities. 

As I stop for the day and the adrenaline stops, I realize I'm exhausted more than usual, and start to chill and develop a fever. I quickly finish setting up camp and go to sleep, hoping to rest up and feel better tomorrow.
