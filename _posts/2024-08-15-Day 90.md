# Day 90:

Today's plan is to leave New Jersey. Whatever I do don't fall for wanting New York ice cream cause it's 25 miles away which is way too far away.

 Start the day with encountering the Walkill River National Wildlife Refuge that leads to Pochuck Mountain. After descending it, the trail heads to the Pochuck Boardwalk. I record a video while crossing on my Instagram then keep moving to the Heaven Hill Farmers Market and Mitchs Roadside Cafe. The boardwalk is over a mile long itself so it's a nice and beautiful change of pace to rock, dirt and roots.

Both are located just 0.1 off trail, with the Cafe being a hot dog stand. I grab a hot dog, bag of chips and a coke and eat. Another hiker and I chat with Mitch himself, who brags about bringing the magic of new York hotdogs to AT hikers. I will say it was a great hot dog plus he made sure to drill me that they had every topping and condiment I could think of.

I stopped by the Heaven Hill Farmers market for ice cream dessert plus some discounted bake goods for later.

It's a brutal climb up to Wawayanda Mountain, called the stairway to heaven, climbing about a thousand feet in 1.4 miles. I also run into Footloose again near the top after not seeing him for a long time, since before I got sick. We catch up for a minute and he goes on ahead of me. After summiting, I encounter another beaver dam before getting to the NY border. 

Right off the bat you get to the highest point in NY called Prospect Rock. Additionally the trail seems to be poorly marked and mostly rock faces. At one point there's a huge iron rung ladder to climb up.

Because of all the rock and walking on ledges there's not many great campsites. NY allows stealth camping anywhere but the only spot I liked already had three people there and I did not want to crowd the place.

So that means.... IM PUSHING TO GET ICE CREAM IN NY. Sure I already had ice cream today but my mother isn't here so I can do what I want. At least my crazy hiker brain with 25 miles in thinks that. I'm absolutely exhausted and annoyed at the crummy trail by the time I get to the turn off for the ice cream.

To my surprise the ice cream place is packed. Like this ain't some small hiker town ice cream store this is a New Yorker tourist destination. There's a huge lawn for picnicking, many tables and a packed parking lot. I get in line with 30 people ahead of me looking like a Bigfoot compared to the nice and clean people. I think I scare families by my smell now.

After waiting a while (and catching up with Footloose walking out with his ice cream), I end up getting a salted caramel milkshake. It was good and I got to enjoy the view.

For some insane reason I get up and hike again. I might as well go to the Wildcat shelter in 2 miles to make a 27.5 mile day. There's nice views at the eastern Pinnicle and Cat Rocks which is supposed to look like a cat, but I can't tell. I get there at sunset and to the shelter in darkness. Fortunately the 3 hikers in the shelter are chill and let me slide in there. I legit just plump my stuff down, put my food in the bearbox and go to sleep. Footloose does wander in after me, but he sets up his tent downhill.
