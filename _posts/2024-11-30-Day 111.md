# Day 104:

Start the day with Serendipity. We both head out of Wilbur Clearing Shelter and head down to North Adam's, MA. As we head through town, through a small neighborhood and some businesses we get a bit of trail magic in coolers. There's some stuff but I only grab a drink since I resupplyed yesterday. Serendipity heads into town to resupply and eat a full meal, while I continue onwards.

There is a neat handprint bridge crossing a river. Just a few miles later I cross out of Massachusetts and into Vermont. With just two more state crossing after this it feels a little weird. However these miles are the hardest so they won't go down without a fight.

A neat thing about the Vermont AT is that it follows the Long Trail for its first 100 miles. After the AT splits off the Long Trail continues to Canada.

I also get a consultation at Consultation Peak.... not really but that would have been neat.

After Stamford branch in Vermont there is another Beaver dam with a mountain pond. I don't see any beavers but it's nice to observe it's still beauty.

I pass Congdon Shelter heading to Harmon Hill, overlooking Bennington, Vermont.

It's a very pretty location, a bit too cloudy to watch the sunset but still beautiful to take in. There was another hiker there as well and we both camp the night.
