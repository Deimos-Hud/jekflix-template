# Day 111:

Start at the bottom of Dana Hill, the rain has let up some but there's still a steady drizzle.

The day is filled with ups and downs and few people on trail. I only see 5 people actually hiking today. Additionally the biting bugs have died down, but gnats and other flying bugs keep harassing me while walking. They always seem to go for my eyes or ears while both of my hands are full.

Other than that today's hike is a hike. I take a short break at Thistle Hill shelter, a shelter like any other. I also lost my spoon somewhere and I have no idea where it went, so I just have to awkwardly scoop stuff out to eat.

The day ends with me going into Norwich, Vermont. The trail has a long road walk into it, but once there I stop by their general store and get...

1 Bacon Burger, 2 slices of cheese pizza, 1 pint of ice cream, 1 liter of diet coke and 6 apple cider donuts. The folk at the store are friendly and help me out. 

I take my goods and head to St Barnabas Church, which allow hikers to use some of their facilities.

I utilize their small kitchen and eat most of the food I bought. They also have several beds, but I opted to tent outside instead, partially I didn't want to dirty anything and also in case other people showed up. Later a section hiker called Stella did show up and used one of the beds.

Meanwhile I set up outside under a canopy they had set up, meaning my tent stayed dry despite the continued rain. Also there's a black cat living at the church that was real friendly and I pet them for a while.
