# Day 41:


I wake up at the Quarter Way Inn. Taxi and I discussed last night that we were going to do a chill day and only do 14 miles to Chestnut Knob Shelter. 

Breakfast is amazing with all sorts of food, to egg bites, pancakes, turkey bacon, fruit, yogurt and more. I spend a long time eating and a longer time getting ressuplied before heading out. They have just about everything I need at the hostel. By 11 am I head out. I actually run into Tigger and Lobster who left very early in the morning to get to the hostel early. They are staying that night so I say my goodbyes.

After the hostel is the hardest creek crossing on the trail, Licks Creek. Years ago the bridge was washed out, so the only way to cross is by going through. The depth of the creek is at 3 feet and moving swift, but there is a rope going across to hold onto. I hike up my shorts, take off my socks and cross.

It's not too bad, but it's slick getting in and out of the creek. Once across I take a short break just to snack and put my dry socks on, and into wet shoes.

The rest of the day goes by swiftly, the hike up to Chestnut Knob is beautiful but daunted by the incoming rain. The shelter itself is at the very top, and is an old fire cabin. It's completely enclosed and made of stone with several wooden cots to sleep on. It's fortunate that it's enclosed as the wind and rain lasts all night. Taxi arrived at the cabin before I did, but we remain alone in the shelter all night.

# Day 42:


Chestnut Knob Shelter was loud last night. The wind was howling but we couldn't feel it at all. We also heard mice but never got interfered by them.

Today's the first clear day in a week, although colder then it has been. The view of the Thumbprint of God is immaculate. Especially with rays of sunshine pouring over the valley. The AT follows part of the ridge for 8 miles.

About 2 miles in we run into Fresh Grounds again, with his whole setup. It's just Taxi and I but he pulls out all the stops. He cooks fresh home fries, pancakes, eggs and bacon with fresh coffee and fruit available. He wanted to move further north to service us as we had not had one of his home cooked meals yet, plus he wanted to meet our group of people.

We head on out. Our plan is to hike 19 miles today and camp when we find a spot. The next bit is a short climb onto the ridge again with the wind shoving us sideways. It's not as bad as it was during NC/TN but it's enough to have to pay attention. It also doesn't help I feel slow from a full stomach.

Eventually the trail dips below the ridge line and I start to feel something that's concerning... boredom. I'm walking on an old logging road that stretches about 6 miles, completely flat, protected from the wind by a ridge blocking the view and nothing but trees with no blooms to my right. It feels like I've walked this stretch for a hundred miles.

Boredom is not great while hiking, it slows you down mentally. Fortunately I've signal here so I decide to switch up my listening routine for a random podcast recommened by spotify. That seems to ease the boredom some.

Eventually I come down the ridge again cross a creek and see Taxi again, who has been ahead all day. We plan to hike another 3-5 miles to a campsite. Taxi walks ahead while I Refill water, then head after some 15 minutes later. I take note to pay attention after 3 miles for his campsite and after 5 miles I start to get worried why I haven't run into him yet.

Before I think I've gone blind he texts me and let's me know that he found a spot by the nearby cell tower. It ends up being a 21 mile day, and we have to set up tents and such still, but we made it safe.
