# Day 84:

Start the day at the New Tripoli campsite. I have a late start and head out around 8:30 AM.

It's slow going at the start, I'm tired from yesterday and my momentum isn't the best. 

I pass by Knifes Edge "The Cliffs" and Bear Rocks, which requires lots of boulder hopping and rock ridges to go over. Closer to bear rocks another hiker spotted a rattle snake and pointed it out to me. It's off the side of the trail so it's harmless.

After passing by the Bake Oven Knob Shelter, the section is pretty beautiful but more barren of trees. The land used to be part of zinc furnaces, and was heavily contaminated with metal. The furnace sites were shut down in the 80s and the wildlife has yet to recover.

Despite that the ridge walk is beautiful and not too horrible. After George Shelter, it's a somewhat steep walk down, to cross the Lehigh river.

The next part is the hardest, the climb out of the river is one of the steepest parts of the AT, going 1000 feet in less than a mile. There is sheer rock that I have to climb carefully. It definitely freaks me out and I worry about staying safe.

Eventually I do make it up, I'm pretty tired at that point and take a brief break just to catch my breath. I finish the day doing another 5 miles to Little Gap. I head to the nearby resort with the Slopeside Pub and Grill. I get crab dip and a burger and it's delicious. I also take advantage and get some more water to carry. I make it back to the trail and set up camp for the night.


# Day 85:

Last night I had a tough time going to bed. A combination of cars and fireworks went till the rain started last night. The rain wasn't too bad and it did stop before I left camp, it just sucks to have my gear wet.

I gather my things and head out for the day. I run into section hikers at camp with a dog off leash, and of course the dog runs straight to me barking and trying to scratch me. Fortunately it's a small dog, but still very rude for them to let such a thing happen.

I keep moving and get more water from jugs left on the side of the trail. It's fortunate people leave these as this section of the trail has hardly any water sources to speak of. It helps me avoid a half mile walk later to get water.

After some more miles I get to Leroy Smith Shelter, where I refill again from a trickling spring, and take lunch. 

Later that afternoon I stop by the town of Wind Gap, to grab an evening snack. By this point it's about 5 PM, and the town is somewhat busy. I walk a few minutes to the Sunoco Gas Station, where they sell quarts of ice cream and I get some Coke and Water. I take a seat at the church across the street and enjoy resting for a few minutes. I then head back to trail and hike.

I've been experimenting with evening hikes lately, to reduce my time during the heat of the day, and it feels much better. The rocks of the trail are rough as my shoes are definitely at the end of their lifespan.

I end at Wolf's Rock southern bypass where a spring is located and Mr. Sunshine has already turned in. I set up my stuff and watch a herd of deer pass through the edge of camp unbothered by my noise. Which is kinda strange since this whole area is hunting grounds in the fall.



# Day 86:

Today I hike 9 miles into Deleware Water Gap. The plan is to get shoes and head out potentially. I mule over what to do either stay doing a nero or head on. Ultimately the day will be short as I need to get to an official campground and can't just camp anywhere.

Mr Sunshine is already gone by the time I start packing. The area isn't too wet, as the rain did not last long. I also stop by the spring to get the last of the water I need and head out.

The Wolf's Rock themselves are pretty to overlook, but very rocky; my worn out shoes struggle to keep a grip on the rocks. At this point the tread is almost bare, but they'll last me till town.

Once in town I stop and chat with 2 townsfolk telling them about my hike. They definitely confirm I'm on the leading edge of through hikers. They also joke about their concern about hiker #666 arriving (since I am #661), I did tell them I never met whoever that is. I stop by a bakers store and get a sweet treat, an apple pie milkshake. Very delicous with slices of apple in it.

I get a ride over to the shoe store and discover they are closed for Memorial day. Unfortunate but it means I can take the day off. I get a room at a nearby Super 8 so I don't have to drive back into Delaware Water Gap and pretty much rest the rest of the day. I did run by a gas station and get some microwave pizzas for dinner so that was a plus. 

I pretty much ended up soaking my feet in the tub and relaxing before going to bed, in a real bed.
