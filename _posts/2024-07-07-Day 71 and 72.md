# Day 71:

I'm the first one out of David Lesser Memorial Shelter. I'm trying to get moving so I can spend more time in Harper's Ferry and with my parents. My parents drove all the way up and will be getting there before 11. It's a gentle hike, and a nice gas station is located just off the trail that I stop by and get some breakfast donuts at. At some point I cross the final Virginia border (the AT has been on the border of WV and VA for some miles and leaves VA to go to Harper's Ferry).

Eventually I cross the bridge to Harper's Ferry, walking by a busy road, then going up a hill towards the town away from the road. After a couple of tenths of a mile, there is a side trail leading to the ATC center in Harper's Ferry, where the organization documents hikers and helps us out. I turn off the AT to head there, and soon run into my Mom and Dad! They were heading down the side trail to meet me at the AT. They walked me towards the center and I was able to log in. So the ATC keeps track of your number based on which way you are hiking. Since I'm heading northbound (NOBO), I started as hiker 661 and at the midpoint in Harper's Ferry, I'm now 152. Based on what I know the big leap is mostly from people who have quit the trail, and the rest is people I passed.

After signing in and taking a picture for the ATC, we went off... to grab lunch of course. We took advantage of the ATC centers parking and went to a restaurant towards the town center. We then grabbed dessert (as in I grabbed dessert and my mom and dad watched in awe as I fit more food in) and did a little shopping. By then it was time to check into the VRBO.

The VRBO is in Harper's Ferry and is pretty much a blue house with 3 bedrooms and laundry and a kitchen, plus a full bath with a tub.

We then went for a walk, exploring Harper's Ferry. It's rich in it's history especially due to it's relevance to civil war. We walked some of the AT including Jerffersons Rock and a cemetery. The streets and trail were packed with people as it was the weekend and mothers day as well.

We ate at a Mexican restaurant for dinner.

# Day 72:

Today my grandparents are visiting, they live in West Virginia so its not too long of a drive. But before they arrived I had to visite the library to email about grad school. My grandma and grandpa arrived while I was still working at the computer. My parents head over to help them unpack before I finish.

After I'm done I head back to the rental to see them. I hadn't seen them in a while, but I'm very thankful they made the trip to see me! Plus it's the beautiful town that we can see together.

By the time I'm done we are all ready for lunch and head to the nearby Ruby Tuesday to eat, and enjoy our lunch, despite the slow service.

Afterwards it's time for my parents to head home, but we have access to the VRBO for one more night. It's sad to see them go, but the sadness doesn't truly hit yet since my grandparents are still with me. We end up exploring the town some, visiting the various shops and exhibits about the AT and the Harper's Ferry.

After walking around and taking a nap back at the VRBO, we head out for dinner. We decide to head out of town to the Golden Corral, but on the way we run into Auggie/Classical walking by. He needs a ride to an out of town hostel to pick up a package, so we shuttle him over and back to help him out. My grandma loves hearing about more of the trail from him and his life beforehand in Hawaii.

We eventually mossey on over to the Golden Corral for dinner. It's a great place to eat with the buffet, but I am feeling pretty full fast due to all the food from town these last couple days. Plus the restaurant has great food for their diets so it's a huge benefit. We chat about all the going on and I talk about everything I've seen and the wonders of God's creation. 

We make our way back. That night I soak myself in the tub and enjoy the relaxing experience. But tomorrow I make my goodbyes and head back on trail.
