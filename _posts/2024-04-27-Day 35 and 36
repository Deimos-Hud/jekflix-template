# Day 35 and 36

Today we get into Damascus! I have 10 miles to hike to get there and in those 10 miles, the AT crosses the Tennessee/Virginia state line. That means today is my last day in Tennessee for a long time. There is a special signpost marking the occasion.

>*Just a little more to Damascus!*

Damascus is famous for its Trail Days event that happens in May. We are there a month before the event so the town isn't too busy. In town I am sharing an apartment with Taxi, Tigger and Lobster. Once I set my stuff down, we get some food at the local diner.

After lunch, I head to the local library to work on the blog. The library is a recent addition, in the towns pursuit of expanding and allowing through hikers like myself to have computer access, a rarity on trail. I work there for a bit before meeting up with the gang again to do some grocery shopping.

The rest of the day we rest. The next day
