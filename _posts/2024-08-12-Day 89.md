# Day 89:

Slept well last night at Gren Anderson shelter. It had rained through most the night, when I had gone to bed the forecast said it would stop around 6 AM and it did. Stargazer and Wild Turkey, the two long section hikers are already up and starting to pack. Wild turkey heads out first then I leave around 8 AM, a later departure time.

I say my goodbyes to Star gazer as she heads south, then get moving. The first stop is Sunrise mountain with a nice covered stone pavilion. I glance at the view then move on. When I pass by the Mashipacong Shelter, Wild Turkey is there taking a water break. I say hey to him and keep moving.

I take a lunch break about 9 miles into the hike where Wild Turkey passes by. But by the 11 mile marker at High Point HQ I see him again taking his lunch. I swing past the hq to use the restroom and get a root beer for a dollar.

From there I go to the observation tower that can see the High Point obelisk, marking New Jersey's highest point. Shortly beyond the tower, the trail begins to level out and become less rocky, which is a blessing. 

The rest of the day passes quickly. I go into Unionville, NY to eat dinner at the Wits End Tavern. It's a little hole in the wall where everyone there are well known locals. But I get mozzarella sticks and fish tacos to satiate myself and have a good meal.

I head out of town heading another 2 miles almost and find a stealth site for camp. I ended up doing almost 22 miles today, and with the new shoes my feet don't hurt nearly as much considering it.
