# Day 54:

Start the day at Petite Gap. My allergies are killing me this morning so I go ahead and take mu allergy meds. Pack up and head out, only to walk .2 miles before realizing I forgot my poles. Not the best start.

Eventually I get going, with a short climb at the very start that I hate to have first. After that the hike is mostly flat to downhill, with a ridge walk to a creek walk. I meet some day hikers near the end of my 10 mile hike into Glasgow and talk a bit about my experiences so far. They are nice to chat to especially since I'm early for my shuttle.

I keep going to the James River Footbridge, the longest foot traffic only bridge on the AT. It takes several minutes to get across. On the other side I get my shuttle. I decided to stay at Stanimals tonight and take a half day. I meet with some other through hikers, and meet some flip floppers who had just started. They started in Dalesville, will go north to Maine, then come back to Virginia and head south to finish. It was cool chatting with them and giving them some advice. We all hit the local restaurant together called Scottos Pizza and I get the calzone special and a milkshake. We also get fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. It was all great.

I ressupply and head back to the hostel for rest. We end up watching the movie Fried Green Tomatoes together, that a hiker donated in 2015. It's a great movie, but it is intense.

I finish off the day by resupplying and head to the bunks for sleep.



# Day 55:

Wake up around 6 AM for breakfast at the hostel. Great homemade blueberry pancakes.

I get a ride along with Squeker at 7 to the Footbridge. I decided to use their slackpacking option and am leaving my main pack behind, in exchange I have a light pack with essentials on it I'll hike the day with.

I hike a few miles to the John's Hollow Shelter and meet a couple of throughikers who ran into Rack (an older gentleman who had been hiking with a few others I know) last night. While going up Little and Big Rocky Row, I ran into Rack.

I'm making very good time due to the light pack, despite the big climb. Once I get to Bluff Mountain it's all downhill. Near the top a kid went missing there a century ago and it's believed the mountain is haunted by their spirit.

The rest of the day is nice, but gets a bit boring as it's not too hard. I eventually make it to US 60, a 22 mile hike, and get a pickup by Stan back to the hostel.

I get to see Carlo again and meet Troubadour. The hostel is not nearly as busy tonight. We head to Scottos Pizza again and I get lasagna and meat balls, which came in a huge serving.

We finish the night watching some Seinfeld and discussing old Star Trek. Tomorrow I leave the hostel for good and have 55 miles left to Waynesboro, the next ressupply point.
