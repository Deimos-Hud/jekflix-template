# Day 47:

From Pine Swamp I get up ready to do 18.5 miles today. While shorter, the elevation gain is rougher, as well as the terrain.

The first few miles are easy enough but eventually the hill kicks in towards Bailey Shelter.

Once at Bailey, the terrain levels out but the rockyness of the trail prevents me from going fast. I catch up with Taxi and we chat about plans and how the mountain feels more like a pile of stones.

Shortly after Wind Rock (a beautiful view of the valley where an elementary field trip was having lunch) Tadpole, Taxi and I had lunch.

At War Spur I see Huge and Waywalker, I briefly chat with them and dip my feet in the creek with them.

The last climb up to Kelly's Knob took a while. The sun was beating down and the stone pathways took a while. When I get up there it feels like it takes forever to walk the last few miles. I take a break at the viewspot where Kelly's knob is, and that helps.

Finally make it to shelter with good time. There's a few section hikers already in the shelter and with the good weather I camp out like most people. There's a strong creek nearby that's real popular for soaking our feet for a break from the heat.
