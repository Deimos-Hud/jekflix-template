# Day 43:

Turns out certain people love backcountry roads. Just like the cemetery a couple cars came right by last night, despite the unusual location. We don't know exactly what they were doing but they never disturb us.

Taxi and I pack up and head out, waving goodbye to the cell tower giving us great signal. The first section of the trail is just a dirt and gravel road walk, eventually turning to pavement. Wild game's car is parked a mile down the trail with some trail magic in boxes. His wife is with him temporarily so he is slackpacking south towards their car. After crossing the interstate we finally get back to a wooded trail.

Today's trip was not too exciting as it was lots of flat walking over old logging roads. The last section is a suspension bridge over the river to get towards the highway. We are staying at Weary Feet hostel which is less then half a mile off the trail.

Once their the old house has a couple bathrooms a kitchen area and of course snacks. It's not too busy with just 3 other people there. But I tell you the dinner was delicious. Spaghetti with Meat Sauce and Chocolate Cake. It was amazing.

Also the beds come with covers and everything so no needing to use my sleeping bag like a lot of hostels.

# Day 44:

Breakfast at Weary Feet is good, pancakes, eggs and sausage. I pay out my tab and finish up as they drive Taxi and I and another customer to the trail. Today we are heading northbound to Docs Knob Shelter.

The first part of the trail is very boggy as Dismal Creek runs nearby, making small creaks form on the trail. There's also about a dozen foot bridges we cross today. The terrain is mostly flat at the start with lots of rotodendrium cover. I mention this as eventually we climb up and beyond the creek, to an altitude where trees are just forming buds. Meanwhile the sky is clear and it's 80+ degrees out.

So we get fried for half the day. The hike itself is not horrible but the rocks and lack of shade makes it hot. When I get to Docs Knob around 4PM, I feel blessed to have good shade. The shelter is also very fancy with a long deck with a picnic table, side benches and a 2 person wooden deck chair in the shade. I plumped down and just relaxed for a good 30 minutes before Taxi arrived.

The water source for the shelter is annoying as it's below a rock bed. The only easy place to get water is where a tree is growing with a small clear pool collecting in it. Usually I try to get water from a strong current but it'll have to do.

Taxi and I chat for a while discuss plans for entering Pearisburg tomorrow and book bunks in a hostel. Eventually after watching some Netflix shows I go to bed.
