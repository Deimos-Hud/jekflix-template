# Day 28:

After a day and a half recovering, I am feeling much better. I pack up the last of my stuff check out and head over to the McDonalds for breakfast before leaving.

Now I did something truly strange, for breakfast I had a coke cause I knew it would be the last chance for a while. After ordering I got an Uber, it was 20 minutes away so I had plenty of time to eat.

The Uber took me to Jerry's hostel right on the AT, and I started my day at 10:30 AM. The hike was relatively flat for the first part as it followed the river and creeks. But eventually it started climbing after Jones Branch Road. The rest of the hike is pretty much a long slow climb uphill for 10 miles. 

There was some coolers for trail magic at Indian Grave Gap, it had some Gatorade and oranges inside. 

Beauty spot was amazing, it was clear and a grassy bald allowing great sightings. There was one more climb after that to the top of Unaka Mountain. At the top there was some folks setting up camp, and they had an antenna and radio kit to talk via Morse code. One gentleman was telling me how they come to the top of mountains and check how far they can contact.

The last few miles were downhill to Cherry Gap Shelter. I got there late at 6:30 but I got to see Waywalker, Lobster, Tigger, Taxi, Local and more again. It was nice to catch up, plus I could set up my tent. Soon enough it was getting dark and I went to bed.

# Day 29:


Lot of people get up and going early. Meanwhile I am still resting up from yesterday. Eventually I leave around 8:30, the first part of the trail is nice and easy. I run into Shelton and his wife heading SOBO today going back to Erwin after slackpacking some.

And the trail soon stops being easy the goal is to get to Roan High Knob shelter, the tallest shelter on the AT. 

The shelters in this area have a neat thing where they have white wooden boards set up that encourage people to carve/mark them instead of the shelter. They seem to be working?

The hike up Roan is beautiful with Thick Fir forests leading up to them. On the way up I meet an amateur radio operator using Morse code and a long antenna attempting to get a signal hundreds of miles away. I think it's pretty neat, but have to keep going.

Near the top is the former site of a hotel that existed a hundred years ago. All that's left now is a few foundation stones.

The shelter is busy but it has tons of capacity with two floors. Most people choose to stay in the shelter, but I and a few others camp out for the night. The tentsites are small as they have warded off large sections for regrowth.
