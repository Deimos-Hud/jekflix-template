# Day 121:


New month and a new day. I wake up early at the lodge and est my provided breakfast. I grab so many eggs, bacon, home fries, french toast, muffins and more I can handle.

I do end up taking a nap after breakfast after eating my full...then getting second breakfast. Honestly one of the best breakfasts I've had on trail. The hotel was overpriced but the breakfast almost made it worth it lol. I end up not leaving till 9:30 or so.

The first mile isn't too bad, walking on the lost pond trail, then we turn to go up the Wildcats. The entire day is grueling technical and steep terrain, some of the worst so far. I'm having to get down on my butt many times just so I can safely descend a ledge. It's also strange how they choose where to place a ladder or put in a foothold. As in many places need it where there aren't any.

I run into Footloose and Whistlin Blue at Carters Notch Hut, where they had leftover turkey and mashed potatoes for us. We chatted for a while how the trail blends together, but the first sections are still so clear.

Eventually they head out and I do too, not before grabbing a snickers bar too. The rest of the day is slow, but I'm not feeling too exhausted. Mt. Heights had some pretty views but after that, it's just hiking.

I head to Imp shelter for the night where there's two different boy camps here, but their counselors have done a good job with them and their polite. They also ask me a lot of questions about the trail and the things I've seen. It's very curious how different the questions from middle schoolers are from adults. I get unique ones about how scared I've been, favorite state and more.

Lots of people in the shelter tonight, two of the camp counselors and a few throughikers.




# Day 122:

Start the day early at imp shelter, to get to town early. I eat what little food I have left and get a move on.

The first task of the hike is climbing Moriah mountain and enjoying one last look at the presidentials and Mount Washington from it. Greenbeard and another hiker named Star Girl is near the top and we chat some about the bad weather at the presidentials. 

The descent is tough but once below 3000 feet and cross Rattle Snake river, the trail flattens out and it speeds up my hike. I manage to do the 8 miles by 10:30 AM, and get to the road into town. Footloose is there about to meet his grandparents.

I manage to get a hitchhike from the first car to Gorham. She is vacationing in the area and knew I had to be a hiker in need. It's not a long drive but she takes me straight to Walmart so I can ressupply there and let's me off. Its really cool cause she is a amateur geologist and following a guide book to interesting hikes to boulders and such.

I spend some time getting my food, and grab a pint of ice cream and a BBQ sandwich to eat outside. I chat with a few of the Walmart workers about the trail.

There are some picnic tables outside I use to repack and eat. After I'm done the town bus just so happened to be passing by. It's doesn't go beyond the town border, but I ride it to the McDonalds, cutting my trip back to trail in half. I do get some food at McDonalds to finish my meal then attempt to hitchhike out. It takes longer but a through hiker from 2017 gives me a ride.

Hiking the trail after a resupply is always rough because of the heavier pack. Plus it's warmer here due to a clear sky and a lower elevation. The trail swings to the west going by Mount Hayes and Cascade Mountain before heading east again. The second half of the day goes slower, but it's nice the trail is not as rocky and technical as before. I also cross mile 1900.

I keep going till mile 1908.5 at Dream Lake. It's a beautiful lake stretching out for a long way, with one of the mountains of the whites in the background. I camp near there and chow down on as much food as I can.
