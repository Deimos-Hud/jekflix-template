# Day 24:

Wake up late due to the rain and wind at Laural Shelter. I discuss plans with Lobster, Ruck and Footloose. We figure out that we can at least do 7 something miles to Jerry's Cabin shelter, and maybe push beyond.

Unfortunately we miss the good hikes of today, including the white cliffs and Howard's Rock. The ridge to the top is intense as there is nothing protecting it from the wind.

After several more miles we make it to Jerry's Cabin, it was an exhausting hike despite the short trip. After taking lunch and seeing the rain pick up I decide to stay in the shelter as well as Lobster.

I hang out for a few hours before heading to bed for the night. I waste a lot of battery watching downloaded Netflix shows cause we barely have enough signal here to send anything. It kinda sucks to go so little ahead after we had a zero day a couple days back, but it's necessary.






# Day 25:


I depart by 7:50. While there is little wind today, there is a thick fog. Unfortunately as I start hiking I feel my crotch chaffing. While I've dealt with chaffing before, usually it's at the end of the day. So I think something I did yesterday meant my legs became chaffed today. 

It slows me down a bit, but I keep going. The top of the mountain has fields with a spooky feel due to fog and the sparse trees. The rest of the hike goes well despite the pain.

Going down to Devil Fork Gap, the AT crosses a road and a fence. The trail uses wooden steps to go over the fence. 

A few tenths of a mile later I take lunch, when Lobster catches up. We chat for a bit as I prepped a large lunch. Afterwards I get going again, but it's a uphill climb and my legs are very chaffed. Despite leaving after lunch first lobster catches up quickly and passes by. 

The climb up Frozen Knob is long but eventually I do make it to the shelter. I take the time to relax eat food and meet up with Lobster, Cold Cuts, Free agent and meet Cutie.

As Lobster gets water, Waywalker and Tigger arrive. They had been pushing it long miles to get to us.

I set up my tent and inspect down below. It's not great to be honest. I can smell the puss from the chaffed skin. After stopping today's hike any walking motion sends jolts of pain. I pray that it'll get better overnight as I have some ointment to help.
