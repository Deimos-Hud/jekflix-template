# Day 101:

Start at October Mountain Shelter. Get a cookie from cookie lady but it's early so no one there is up and head out. If i got there later there is also berry picking there. Deal with some minor chaffing issues while hiking, but nothing some desitin won't fix.

Hike is minor with some hills but get to Dalton shortly before parents and get a snack at gas station. Of course I grab a sandwich and a donut there before they meet me. Shortly after I finish eating, they meet me and we get pizza with some leftovers. Head to VRBO in the nearby town. It's a nice house built in the 1880s and has multiple units. We get a full kitchen, a living room and 2 bedrooms, which I take the upstairs one. There's only one bathroom but since I'm the only stinky hiker it's not too big of an issue. My parents require I bath immediately though. Rest and go to market for my ressupply and grab dinner later.

# Day 102:

Next day I sleep in. We all go to outfitter and shop around for anything I may need. I finally replace my tent stakes I lost. We walk a little bit together in Kennedy Shop behind the outfitter, someone remarks on my hiking in candles, but I let them know I am taking a zero day. 

We need something to do so we end up going to The Mount, an authentic early 1900s estate and home to Edith Wharton. We tour the gardens, the exhibits and the statues. We have a couple run in with bugs attacking my dad as we left, but overall we had fun.

It was a good day and I was able to see my parents again, and I plan to hike out with my dad tomorrow!
