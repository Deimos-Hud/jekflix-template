# Day 100:

Get up and start moving, the first thing of real note during the day is the Tyringham Cobble, an exposed rock plate atop the ridge, it's a nice little park and with several families walking around and picnicking. 


There is a farmers food stand after Tyringham Cobbles that has some goodies outside the farmstead using the honor system. I get an icicle, a Gatorade and some candy. It's a smart system built there as there's wifi, since there's no cell signal, to venmo them. 

I keep in communication with Mom and Dad when I can today, they should be picking me up tomorrow around Dalton, Massachusetts. We picked up a VRBO so hopefully that's nice. 

Today I had multiple animal encounters. Earlier in the day I saw a porcupine. That was neat to see running around. But in a scarier sense as I was crossing County Road 2 miles before October Mountain Shelter I saw my first black bear of the trip.

It was a momma bear with a cub, they spooked pretty easily but I made sure to keep my head on a swivel for them later.

The path up to October Mountain had been hit with tornados in the past which left tons of fallen trees to the sides of the trail. There is no one else at the shelter when I arrive so I make my camp and head to bed for the night.
