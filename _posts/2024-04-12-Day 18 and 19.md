# Day 18:

A bit of an early start. There is a bit of a drive between my Aunt and Uncle's place and Newfound Gap, so waking up early is necessary.

My Aunt prepped some great breakfast for me including eggs, sausage and cinnamon rolls. Additionally they gave me some nice sweets to bring with me.

We make it back to Newfound Gap, grab some photos together and then we part ways. I also take advantage of the bathrooms there one last time.

The climb out of the gap is not too bad, but I am able to see Charlies Bunion by myself. It's off a short side path of the AT. The rock formation there juts out from the trail. It's another clear day so the sightline is pretty good from it as well.

Moving foward, the rest of the day comes and goes. Some trail maintainers check for my permit, which I present then we chat for a few minutes.

Following the ridge, I eventually make it to Tri-Corner Shelter, where a large trail family is setting up. I meet MacGyver, Mr. Happy and more. Lobster and Taxi are at the shelter ahead but I'll likely catch them in the next few days.


# Day 19:


I wake up very early today, around 6 AM. I made a mistake by not talking with the folks in the shelter about their morning routine. Turns out they like to wake up really early so they can handle stuff.

They try to stay quite but the headlamps wake me up. I go about getting my stuff together and heading out.

I was inspired by Mcgyvers comment yesterday to go explore another section of the Smokies. I decide to take a side route off the AT to visit Gunter Fork Trail and Big Creek Trail. It means I walk an extra 2 miles compared to the AT but it means I get to see the big river. The trail is neat, with lots of waterfalls and secret pools. There is one tricky river crossing that meant I got wet up to my knees, but the warmer weather makes it feel great.

The last 5 miles or so is a rocky road next to the creek, it's relaxing but feels like it lasted longer than it did. Eventually I make it to the end and rebook up to the AT near the edge of the Smokies. I do another mile or so and stop at a campsite before the interstate. I end up having it to myself, which marks my second time out here camping alone.
