# Day 105:

I pack up my things at Harmon Hill, overlooking Bennington, VT. It was a beautiful place for camp, but the time has come to set off.

Today I'm doing 20.8 miles to Story Spring. The worst part of today is the climb after the road of VT. 9. I took a quick bathroom break there, and make my way up. The climb from there to the top of Glastenbury Mountain is over 2500 feet.

The area is beautiful but unfortunately the top of the mountain should have an observation tower, and it still does. Except it's shut down and the bottom stairs removed. Deeply unfortunate especially since there is no views otherwise.

The rest of the day is a gentler hike, with some views of Beaver dams again. I end it at Story Spring Shelter and to my surprise I have the whole shelter and campsite to myself.

# Day 106:

I wake up at Story Spring Shelter in Vermont. Not only did it get to 39 degrees last night but my pad has also sprung a leak, so it no longer inflates properly. I've had this sleeping pad for a long time, my father bought it around 15 years ago, and it's been on most trips with us. We certainly got our money's worth out of it.

I start the hike up Stratton Mountain, nearing 4000 feet tall. The summit is all fir trees. The summit has a few people at it, mostly from the nearby ski lodge and gondola. The top of the mountain has a firetower that is well above the tree line with a beautiful view beyond. From the tower one can see Massachusetts and New Hampshire from it.

I meet some people there, one hiker doing the Long Trail of Vermont, and two other day hikers asking about the AT.

The rest of the day goes by quickly, with a slow downhill for most of it. I take a break on the side of the trail on a fallen tree. I also stop by Spruce Peak Shelter later, which is an enclosed cabin with sliding door and fire stove inside. I also have to put out some embers left in the outdoor fire pit.

I end the hike at 23 miles at Bromley Shelter. I set up my tent on a tent pad for the first time, with difficulties getting it tied down, due to the far spaced bull horns meant for my tent ties.
