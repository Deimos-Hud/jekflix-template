# My Gear

First off an update, I just wanted to thank everyone reading this blog and your support! Several people were asking if there was a way to support me on my trip! I have set up a buy me a coffee account, where you can send anything you want to support me! I plan to use the money in support of this website first, then my hike. You can find the page here at [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hikethehike](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hikethehike)

## The Big Three

The "Big Three" are the top three items, your tent, sleeping bag and of course your pack.

### The Tent; Gossamer Gear's The One

Nice and lightweight, uses my trekking poles for support.

### Sleeping Bag; Nemo Tempo 20F

Supports temperatures to 20 degrees, and is comfy to sleep in! You can find a link to it here ->

### The Pack; Osprey Aether 65L

The Osprey pack has served me well these past few years. While a bit on the heavier side, it has quite a bit of room for all of my gear. You can find a link to it here ->
